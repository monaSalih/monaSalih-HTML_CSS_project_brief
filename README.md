# 📝 JS Capstone Project: Personalized Productivity Dashboard

## 🎯 Project Overview

The **Personalized Productivity Dashboard** is a dynamic, interactive web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project allows students to create a dashboard with features such as a greeting message, to-do list management, daily motivational quotes from an external API, and a light/dark mode toggle that stores user preferences in Web Storage. This will help students integrate and apply the key JavaScript concepts learned throughout the course.

## 🌍 Project Context

As a **junior developer at a startup**, you are tasked with building a **Personal Productivity Dashboard** MVP that runs in any browser without server-side code. The dashboard will enable users to:

- Add, edit, and delete tasks 📋.
- View a daily motivational quote (pulled from an API).
- Switch between light and dark themes 🌑☀️.
